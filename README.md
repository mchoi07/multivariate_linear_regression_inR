# multivariate_linear_regression_in R

Using the data describe below, I fit the regression model with several different method. 

* `multi_linear_regression.R` : This is just regular mult-regression model. I tested model in several ways. You can also see PCA technique - it didn't work well because of samll size of the data. 

* `tree_regression.R` : 

* `random_forest_regression.R` :
